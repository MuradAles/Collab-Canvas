# CollabCanvas - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority: PR #6 - Multiplayer Cursors
**Status**: Ready to begin
**Goal**: Implement real-time cursor tracking for all connected users

**Key Tasks**:
1. Design Realtime Database schema for cursor positions
2. Create cursor service for position updates
3. Build cursor component with user colors and names
4. Integrate cursor tracking into canvas
5. Handle coordinate transformation (screen to canvas-relative)
6. Implement cursor cleanup on disconnect

**Technical Requirements**:
- Canvas-relative coordinates (cursors stay in place when panning/zooming)
- Throttled updates (20-30 FPS, not full 60Hz)
- Unique colors per user
- Smooth movement without jitter
- <50ms sync latency

### Next Up: PR #7 - User Presence System
**Status**: Pending PR #6 completion
**Goal**: Show who's online and active on the canvas

**Key Tasks**:
1. Design presence schema (combined with cursor data)
2. Create presence service for online/offline status
3. Build presence list component
4. Add presence to navbar
5. Handle auto-disconnect cleanup

## Recent Changes

### Completed: UI/UX Improvements
**Date**: Most recent
**Impact**: Enhanced user experience and workflow efficiency

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Fixed delete key behavior (Delete key deletes, Backspace does nothing)
- ✅ Improved text creation with default "Text" content and auto-selection
- ✅ Added comprehensive tutorial with keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Better text editing workflow with immediate focus and selection

**Technical Details**:
- Updated keyboard event handler to only respond to Delete key
- Enhanced text shape creation with default content
- Created Tutorial component with modal interface
- Improved text editing UX with auto-focus and text selection

### Completed in PR #5: Real-Time Synchronization
**Date**: Previous
**Impact**: Major milestone - core collaboration functionality

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Firestore integration with real-time shape sync
- ✅ Object locking system (lock on drag start, unlock on drag end)
- ✅ Visual lock indicators with user names
- ✅ Auto-release locks on disconnect/timeout
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ 14 new tests passing (50 total tests)

**Technical Details**:
- Single global canvas document: `canvas/global-canvas-v1`
- Real-time updates via Firestore `onSnapshot`
- Lock management with Firebase `onDisconnect()`
- 5-second timeout for auto-release
- Visual feedback: "🔒 [User] is editing"

### Previous Milestones
- **PR #4**: Shape Creation & Manipulation (rectangles, circles, text)
- **PR #3**: Basic Canvas Rendering (pan, zoom, controls)
- **PR #2**: Authentication System (email/password + Google)
- **PR #1**: Project Setup & Firebase Configuration

## Current System State

### What's Working
- ✅ User authentication (email/password + Google OAuth)
- ✅ Canvas rendering with pan/zoom (5000x5000px)
- ✅ Shape creation via click-and-drag
- ✅ Shape selection, movement, and deletion
- ✅ Real-time shape synchronization across users
- ✅ Object locking prevents edit conflicts
- ✅ Visual lock indicators show who's editing
- ✅ Persistent state across page refreshes
- ✅ 50 passing tests

### What's Missing (MVP Requirements)
- ❌ Multiplayer cursors (next priority)
- ❌ User presence system
- ❌ Final testing and polish
- ❌ Production deployment

### Current Architecture
```
React App (TypeScript)
├── AuthContext (Firebase Auth)
├── CanvasContext (Firestore sync)
├── Canvas Component (Konva.js)
├── Shape Components (Rectangles, Circles, Text)
└── Services (Firebase integration)
```

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **Cursor Implementation**: Using Firebase Realtime Database for high-frequency updates
2. **Coordinate System**: Canvas-relative coordinates for cursors (not screen coordinates)
3. **Update Frequency**: Throttled to 20-30 FPS for cursor updates
4. **User Colors**: Random assignment from predefined palette

### Design Decisions
1. **Cursor Appearance**: SVG cursor icon with user name label
2. **Color Assignment**: Consistent per user throughout session
3. **Position Display**: Canvas-relative so cursors stay in place when panning/zooming
4. **Cleanup Strategy**: Auto-remove cursors on disconnect

### Performance Considerations
- Cursor updates must not impact canvas performance
- Throttling needed to prevent excessive Firebase writes
- Efficient coordinate transformation for smooth movement
- Memory cleanup on component unmount

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Start PR #6**: Begin multiplayer cursor implementation
2. **Design Schema**: Define Realtime Database structure for cursors
3. **Create Service**: Build cursor service for position updates
4. **Build Component**: Create cursor component with user colors

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. **Complete PR #6**: Finish cursor implementation and testing
2. **Start PR #7**: Begin user presence system
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with multiple users
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify 60 FPS with cursors

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Complete PR #7**: Finish presence system
2. **PR #8**: Testing, polish, and bug fixes
3. **PR #9**: Production deployment
4. **MVP Completion**: All requirements met

## Known Issues and Risks

### Current Issues
- None identified in recent testing

### Potential Risks
1. **Cursor Performance**: High-frequency updates might impact performance
2. **Coordinate Accuracy**: Screen-to-canvas transformation complexity
3. **User Color Conflicts**: Need distinct colors for multiple users
4. **Cleanup Reliability**: Ensure cursors are removed on disconnect

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Throttling**: Limit cursor updates to 20-30 FPS
2. **Testing**: Extensive multi-user testing
3. **Color Palette**: Predefined distinct colors
4. **Firebase onDisconnect**: Reliable cleanup mechanism
