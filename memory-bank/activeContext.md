- **PR #3**: Basic Canvas Rendering (pan, zoom, controls)
- **PR #2**: Authentication System (email/password + Google)
- **PR #1**: Project Setup & Firebase Configuration

## Current System State

- âœ… Canvas rendering with pan/zoom (5000x5000px)
- âœ… Shape creation via click-and-drag
- âœ… Shape selection, movement, and deletion

### Current Architecture
```
React App (TypeScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ AuthContext (Firebase Auth)
â”œâ”€â”€ CanvasContext (Firestore sync)
â”œâ”€â”€ Canvas Component (Konva.js)
â”œâ”€â”€ Shape Components (Rectangles, Circles, Text)
â””â”€â”€ Services (Firebase integration)
```

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **Cursor Implementation**: Using Firebase Realtime Database for high-frequency updates
2. **Coordinate System**: Canvas-relative coordinates for cursors (not screen coordinates)
3. **Update Frequency**: Throttled to 20-30 FPS for cursor updates
4. **User Colors**: Random assignment from predefined palette

### Design Decisions
1. **Cursor Appearance**: SVG cursor icon with user name label
2. **Color Assignment**: Consistent per user throughout session
3. **Position Display**: Canvas-relative so cursors stay in place when panning/zooming
4. **Cleanup Strategy**: Auto-remove cursors on disconnect

### Performance Considerations
- Cursor updates must not impact canvas performance
- Throttling needed to prevent excessive Firebase writes
- Efficient coordinate transformation for smooth movement
- Memory cleanup on component unmount

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Advanced Collaboration Features ðŸš€

**Build Order:**
1. **Week 1-3**: Projects & Pages System (Foundation)
   - Multi-project workspace
   - Invite system with shareable links
   - Permission roles (View/Edit/Admin)
   - Page management per project
   - Global Canvas for all users

2. **Week 4-5**: Grouping System
   - Press G to group selected shapes
   - Nested groups support
   - Group properties (position, rotation, colors)
   - LayersPanel hierarchy with drag & drop
   - Double-click to enter group edit mode

3. **Week 6-7**: Endless Canvas
   - Canvas bounds: -50,000 to +50,000 (100k x 100k)
   - Viewport culling for performance
   - Navigation helpers (Go to User, Jump to Shape)
   - Maintain 60 FPS with 1000+ shapes

4. **Week 8**: Integration & Launch
   - Cross-feature testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation
   - Production deployment

**Current Status:** 
- âœ… Planning complete (PRD + Task Lists)
- ðŸ”œ Starting with Projects & Pages System

## Known Issues and Risks

### Current Issues
- None identified in recent testing

### Potential Risks
1. **Cursor Performance**: High-frequency updates might impact performance
2. **Coordinate Accuracy**: Screen-to-canvas transformation complexity
3. **User Color Conflicts**: Need distinct colors for multiple users
4. **Cleanup Reliability**: Ensure cursors are removed on disconnect

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Throttling**: Limit cursor updates to 20-30 FPS
2. **Testing**: Extensive multi-user testing
3. **Color Palette**: Predefined distinct colors
4. **Firebase onDisconnect**: Reliable cleanup mechanism
