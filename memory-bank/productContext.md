# CollabCanvas - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Design teams need tools to collaborate in real-time on visual projects, but existing solutions are either:
- Too complex and feature-heavy for simple collaborative sketching
- Not optimized for real-time multi-user editing
- Missing the "Figma-like" experience for basic shape manipulation

### Solution
CollabCanvas provides a lightweight, real-time collaborative canvas where teams can:
- Quickly sketch ideas together
- See each other's cursors and presence
- Work simultaneously without conflicts
- Focus on collaboration without feature bloat

## Target Users

### Primary User: Designer/Creator
- **Needs**: Quick visual collaboration, real-time feedback, simple tools
- **Pain Points**: Complex tools slow down ideation, lack of real-time collaboration
- **Goals**: Rapidly prototype ideas with team members

### Secondary User: Collaborator
- **Needs**: Join existing sessions, see team progress, contribute ideas
- **Pain Points**: Missing context when joining, conflicts during editing
- **Goals**: Seamlessly join and contribute to ongoing design sessions

## User Experience Goals

### Core Experience
1. **Instant Collaboration**: Users can join and start collaborating immediately
2. **Conflict-Free Editing**: Object locking prevents simultaneous edits to same shape
3. **Visual Awareness**: See who's online, where they're working, what they're editing
4. **Smooth Performance**: 60 FPS interactions, sub-100ms sync
5. **Intuitive Controls**: Click-and-drag creation (like Figma), familiar keyboard shortcuts

### Key User Flows

#### New User Flow
1. Visit app URL
2. Sign up with email or Google
3. Immediately see shared canvas
4. Start creating shapes with click-and-drag
5. See other users' cursors and presence

#### Collaborative Editing Flow
1. User A creates rectangle
2. User B sees it appear in real-time
3. User A starts dragging → shape locks with "User A is editing" indicator
4. User B cannot move locked shape, sees clear visual feedback
5. User A stops dragging → lock releases, User B can now edit

#### Multi-User Session Flow
1. Multiple users join canvas
2. Each gets unique cursor color
3. All see each other's cursors and presence
4. Can work on different parts of canvas simultaneously
5. Changes sync in real-time across all users

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Sync Latency**: <100ms for shape changes, <50ms for cursors
- **Performance**: 60 FPS with 500+ shapes
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime, no data loss
- **Concurrency**: Support 5+ simultaneous users

### User Experience Metrics
- **Time to First Shape**: <30 seconds from landing to creating first shape
- **Conflict Resolution**: 100% of edit conflicts resolved by locking system
- **User Retention**: Users return to continue collaborative sessions
- **Session Duration**: Average session length indicates engagement

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- **Figma**: Too complex for simple collaboration, requires account setup
- **Miro**: Board-focused, not optimized for precise shape manipulation
- **Excalidraw**: Single-user focused, limited real-time features

### Competitive Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Focused on core collaboration without feature bloat
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time editing with many objects
- **Instant Access**: No complex setup, immediate collaboration
- **Conflict Resolution**: Robust locking system prevents edit conflicts

## Future Vision

### Phase 2 (Post-MVP)
- Multiple shape types (circles, text, lines)
- Shape styling (colors, borders, effects)
- Resize and rotate functionality
- Multi-select and grouping
- Undo/redo system

### Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
- AI agent integration for design assistance
- Multiple projects/canvases
- Export functionality
- Mobile optimization
- Advanced collaboration features (comments, version history)

## Success Definition
The MVP is successful when:
1. A team of 5+ people can collaborate effectively on a shared canvas
2. All real-time features work reliably under normal usage
3. The app performs smoothly with hundreds of shapes
4. Users can complete collaborative design sessions without technical issues
5. The foundation is solid for future feature development
