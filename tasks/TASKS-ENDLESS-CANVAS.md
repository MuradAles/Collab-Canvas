# Tasks: Endless Canvas

## Status Summary

### âœ… CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE
The endless canvas feature is **functionally working**! All essential features have been implemented:
- Canvas expanded to 25,000 x 25,000 pixels (0 to 25k) - different from original plan but working
- Viewport culling active - only renders visible shapes
- Performance monitoring shows "X of Y shapes" in LayersPanel
- Double-click navigation to shapes in LayersPanel
- Navigate to users by double-clicking their avatars in Navbar
- AI position commands updated for new canvas size
- Shape position validation and clamping
- Grid rendering optimized for new bounds

### ðŸ”§ REMAINING WORK
Most remaining tasks are **polish, testing, and optimizations** (not critical for functionality):
- **Optional UX improvements**: Position indicator, smooth animations, highlight effects
- **Testing**: Performance testing, multi-user testing, edge cases
- **Optimization**: Performance warnings, FPS monitoring, load optimization
- **Documentation**: Update tutorials and developer docs

### ðŸ“Š Canvas Bounds Decision
**Note**: The canvas uses **0 to 25,000** bounds instead of the originally planned **-50,000 to +50,000**. This was an implementation decision that simplifies coordinates (all positive) while still providing a massive canvas (625x larger than the original 5000x5000).

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Time**: 12-15 hours
- **Phase 1** (Tasks 1-5): Core Implementation - 4-5 hours
- **Phase 2** (Tasks 6-10): Navigation & UX - 3-4 hours
- **Phase 3** (Tasks 11-16): Optimization & Testing - 3-4 hours
- **Phase 4** (Tasks 17-20): Polish & Launch - 2-3 hours

## Dependencies
- Should be implemented after Projects & Pages (for per-page canvas)
- Can be done in parallel with Grouping (independent features)
- Tasks 1-4 must be completed first (foundation)
- Tasks 5-10 are core features (do in order)
- Tasks 11-20 are optimization and polish

## Performance Targets
- **60 FPS** maintained during pan/zoom with 1000+ shapes
- **< 100ms** to calculate visible shapes (viewport culling)
- **< 500ms** initial load time for 1000 shapes
- **< 16MB** memory increase per 1000 shapes
- **100,000 x 100,000** total canvas area (400x larger than current)

## Notes
- Viewport culling is key to performance
- Load all shapes but only render visible ones
- Real-time sync unchanged (Firestore listeners)
- No spatial indexing needed for expected shape counts
- Buffer zone ensures smooth panning (no pop-in)
- Test extensively with large shape counts
