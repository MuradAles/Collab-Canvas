## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Time**: 10-12 hours
- **Phase 1** (Tasks 1-3): Foundation & Types - 2 hours
- **Phase 2** (Tasks 4-9): Core Functionality - 4-5 hours
- **Phase 3** (Tasks 10-15): UI & Advanced Features - 3-4 hours
- **Phase 4** (Tasks 16-18): Integration & Polish - 1-2 hours

## Dependencies
- Requires Projects & Pages system (for per-page groups)
- Tasks 1-3 must be completed first (foundation)
- Tasks 4-9 are core functionality (do in order)
- Tasks 10-15 can be done in parallel after core
- Task 16 depends on all core features
- Tasks 17-18 are final steps

## Notes
- Groups are stored as regular shapes (type: 'group') in Firestore
- Use Konva.Group for efficient rendering
- Real-time sync uses same mechanism as other shapes
- Circular nesting prevention is critical
- Test thoroughly with nested structures
