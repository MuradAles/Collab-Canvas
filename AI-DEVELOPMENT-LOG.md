# CollabCanvas - AI Development Log

## Project Overview
**Status**: MVP Complete - Ready for Production  
**Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Konva.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase  
**Tests**: 78 passing | **Performance**: 60 FPS, <50ms cursor sync

---

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Vite Configuration & TypeScript Setup
**Problem**: TypeScript error - `Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'PluginOption'`

**Solution**:
- Moved Tailwind from Vite plugins to PostCSS plugins
- Changed import from `vite` to `vitest/config` for test typing

---

### 2. Tailwind CSS v4 Migration
**Problem**: Styles not appearing, PostCSS warnings

**Solution**:
- Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
- Added `@import "tailwindcss";` to `src/index.css`
- Removed all default Vite CSS (single import replaces `@tailwind` directives)

---

### 3. TypeScript Compilation Errors (6 Fixed)
**Problems**: Type imports, require() usage, JSX namespace, timer types

**Solutions**:

1. **Type-Only Imports**:
   ```typescript
   import { useState, type FormEvent } from 'react';
   ```

2. **ES6 Imports**: Replaced `require('./Signup').Signup` with proper imports

3. **JSX Namespace**: Added `import type { JSX } from 'react';`

4. **Timer Types**: Changed `NodeJS.Timeout` to `number` for browser compatibility

---

## MVP Completion (9/9 PRs)

1. âœ… Project Setup & Firebase
2. âœ… Authentication (email + Google OAuth)
3. âœ… Canvas Rendering (pan, zoom, 5000x5000px)
4. âœ… Shape Creation & Manipulation
5. âœ… Real-Time Sync
6. âœ… Multiplayer Cursors (<50ms sync)
7. âœ… User Presence System
8. âœ… Testing & Polish (78 tests)
9. âœ… Production Deployment Ready

## Key Technical Decisions

### Real-Time Architecture
- **Firestore**: Shape persistence and sync
- **Realtime Database**: High-frequency cursor updates
- **Object Locking**: First-to-drag locks, 5-second timeout, auto-release on disconnect

### Performance
- **Fire-and-forget**: Cursor updates with no throttling
- **React.memo**: Shape component optimization
- **Canvas-relative coordinates**: Consistent multi-user experience

### TypeScript
- **verbatimModuleSyntax**: Strict type-only imports
- **Browser Types**: Use `number` for timers, not `NodeJS.Timeout`

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Tailwind v4**: Needs `@tailwindcss/postcss` + single `@import "tailwindcss";`
2. **Firebase Strategy**: Separate Firestore (persistent) from Realtime DB (ephemeral)
3. **Cursor Performance**: Fire-and-forget beats throttling for ultra-low latency
4. **TypeScript**: Type-only imports required with `verbatimModuleSyntax`

---

## Development Journey Summary

### Phase 0: Foundation & Preparation
You started by building your stack with **React + Vite** to establish fundamentals, then added **Firebase keys**. Next, you pasted your **PRD, tasks, and architecture** files into Cursor and asked the AI probing questions: *"Do you understand everything? Do you need help with anything? Ask me questions if something is unclear."* This approach came from watching YouTube videos where you learned that AI performs better when you let it clarify requirements first - it might even catch things you missed.

**Your approach**: Validate understanding before building. Better to fix gaps in requirements than in code.

---

### Phase 1: Authentication System (~Task 1)
Following your task list step-by-step, you asked AI to handle the first task: *"Create auth context, auth service, auth hook, build signup component, build login component, create auth provider wrapper, update app with protected routes, create navbar component, and write auth tests."* When it finished, you **manually tested everything** - can I log in? Can I log out? You hit a snag: forgot to enable Google authentication in the Firebase console, and spent time wondering what went wrong. Once you enabled it, everything worked perfectly.

**Your lesson**: AI executes well, but you need to verify infrastructure setup (Firebase config) manually.

---

### Phase 2: Canvas Rendering (~Task 2) 
This was straightforward in concept: create canvas context, build canvas component, implement pan functionality, implement zoom in/out, create canvas controls, add canvas to app, and write tests. **But it broke the first time.** You tried fixing it, but when you looked at the result, you didn't like it. Your thought process: *"If something doesn't work, I'll redo it - as long as I'm not too far in."* You took a step back, went to ChatGPT, and asked: *"How can I do this better?"* After gathering information, you returned to Cursor with specific requirements: *"I want a grid, I want it to look like this, I want it full-screen,"* etc. **The second attempt succeeded.**

**Your lesson**: Don't be afraid to restart early when the foundation is wrong. Research first, then implement with clarity.

---

### Phase 3: Shape Creation & Manipulation (~Task 3)
This task wasn't particularly hard, but **AI didn't completely follow your instructions**. You asked to create two shapes that can be moved, but it only created one shape - a rectangle. You had to ask again: *"Can you follow the instructions provided in the tasks and PRD? If you need some help, tell me."* After that, it started working correctly. Looking back, you think AI either forgot or didn't read the instructions carefully - or maybe you needed to provide more information upfront.

**Your lesson**: AI sometimes misses details. Be explicit and reference your docs when course-correcting.

---

### Phase 4: Real-Time Synchronization (~Task 4)
This went **really well on the first try!** You let AI handle the Firebase integration, knowing it needed to use Realtime Database and Firestore to hold all the information. You just let it write, and it did everything correctly - information was updating online immediately. You were amazed. You also used **Context7 to help get Firebase documentation and setup information**, which helped a lot. One issue: it was lagging - updating every 1-2 seconds on different screens. You asked AI to decrease the update interval, and it fixed the lag.

**Your lesson**: AI excels at standard integrations (Firebase sync). Performance tuning requires your judgment.

---

### Phase 5: Multiplayer Cursors (~Task 5)
For the cursor service, you told AI: *"Use the same thing as we did with object movement."* Your reasoning: cursors are just objects that can't be moved by users - they just track movement. **It did it perfectly!** But again, you had to tell it to go faster because it was still updating slowly (every one second). Not lagging exactly, just updating slowly. After you requested faster updates, it optimized perfectly.

**Your lesson**: Reusing patterns saves time. Performance expectations need explicit requirements.

---

### Phase 6: Configuration & TypeScript Issues
Build tools created friction: Vite/Tailwind v4 setup issues, TypeScript errors (type-only imports, timer types, JSX namespace). AI fixed these systematically as you encountered them.

**Your lesson**: Modern tooling has sharp edges. AI handles configuration fixes well when you provide error messages.

---

### Phase 7: UI Polish & Beauty (The Time Sink)
After core features worked, you spent significant time **making the UI beautiful**. This project took you longer than expected because you tried to make everything look good. You spent considerable time building UI components and going back-and-forth with AI on styling. Looking back, you think you should have spent less time on the UI parts and focused more on the core project. **The actual project took about 6 hours** - the rest of the time was spent making it more beautiful.

**Your reflection**: Core features took ~6 hours. UI beautification added substantial time. For MVPs, prioritize function over form.

---

### The Result
**Time investment**: ~6 hours for core functionality, additional time for UI polish. You built a production-ready real-time collaborative canvas with authentication, shape manipulation, object locking, multiplayer cursors, and presence awareness. All while manually testing, iterating on failures, and making architectural decisions about performance tuning.

**Your development style**: 
1. **Validate first** - Ask AI to confirm understanding
2. **Test manually** - Don't trust, verify
3. **Restart when wrong** - Cut losses early if foundation is broken
4. **Research before implementing** - ChatGPT for approaches, then execute
5. **Be explicit** - Reference docs when AI misses requirements
6. **Reuse patterns** - "Same as X" saves time
7. **Performance tune** - AI gives defaults, you set the bar
8. **Polish separately** - Core features first, beauty later (lesson learned)
